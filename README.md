In this project, I made the process of adding the house price prediction model that I made in the https://github.com/senolomer0/WebScraping_HousePricePrediction  project to an application.

This application, after receiving the housing information from the user, sends this information to the machine learning model that has been trained before and makes a house price estimation.

Inside the Setup folder, there is the installation file of this program for windows. With this setup file, you can easily install and use the program on your computer. But windows detects this program as a virus, so I suggest you turn off the firewall before downloading it. This program is turned into an exe file with the pyinstaller in python, and then it is turned into a setup file with the "Inno Setup Compiler" program.

In the Code folder, there are the code block of the program, the machine learning model and the images used in the program.
